    "There exists huge inequality, whether in gender, race, or income, in our current world. Among all of that, income is one of the most important factors. I want to present data and analysis in this field to raise people's awareness of such a gap, and hopefully, it can remind us how privileged we are. I hope to explore the relationship between educational attainment and personal income in the state of California. My research goal is to identify how is income inequality related to the college completion rate? (compare the income value of different groups with their corresponding college completion status)"

In this case, to present data and analysis in the field of education inequality to raise people's awareness of some huge gaps that might still exist even though we have come a long way.\n",

    "\n",
    "For 25- to 34-year-olds who worked full time, year round in 2019, higher educational attainment was associated with higher median earnings. This pattern was consistent from 2010 through 2019. For example, in 2019 the median earnings of those with a master’s or higher degree (70,000 dollors) were 26 percent higher than the earnings of those with a bachelor's degre (55,700 dollors), and the median earnings of those with a bachelor’s degree were 59 percent higher than the earnings of those who completed high school (35,000 dollors)\n",

    "\n",
    "U.S. citizens with a professional degree had the highest median household income in 2020, at 151,560 U.S. dollars. In comparison, those with less than a 9th grade education made significantly less money, at 29,609 U.S. dollars.\n",

    "Most of the studies I showed present data in the bar chart to show the demographics of the data or the line chart to show the increment or decrement of the salary or population change in the annual salary of residents in California. To display the relationship between personal income and educational attainment, I can show the demographics of the data in a bar chart to better visualize it. "
